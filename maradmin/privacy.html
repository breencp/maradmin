    files include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp,
    referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is personally
    identifiable. The purpose of the information is for analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users'

<h2>Google Analytics</h2>
We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects
information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they
used prior to coming to this site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google
Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other
identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally
identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a
unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use
and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a
        href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">Google Analytics
